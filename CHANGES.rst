Changes
=======


1.4.0 (2023-06-27)

* Removed support for Python 2.


1.3.0 (2023-05-24)
------------------

* Support the NO_COLOR environment variable for disabling color autodetection
  (see https://no-color.org/).

  the closing parenthesis (`issue 5

1.2.1 (2022-10-28)
------------------

* Add support for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.

* Show line numbers when complaining about malformed input lines.
* Handle "[pid  NNN]" prefixes with more than one space.


1.2.0 (2019-08-23)
------------------

* Colorize the output if your terminal supports color.

* Speed up strace log parsing by 40%.


1.1.0 (2019-08-22)
------------------

* Show process running times when the strace log has timestamps
  (i.e. -t/-tt/ -ttt was passed to strace).
* Fix tree construction to avoid duplicating processes when execve()
  shows up in the log before the parent's clone() resumes.


1.0.0 (2019-08-21)

* Moved to its own repository on GitHub, added a README and this changelog.
* First release to PyPI.

------------------

* Use Python 3 by default.


0.8.0 (2019-06-05)
------------------

* Parse more strace log variations: pids shown as "[pid NNN]", timestamps
  formatted as "HH:MM:SS.ssss" (strace -t/-tt versus -ttt that we already
  handled).


0.7.0 (2019-04-10)
------------------

* Do not lose information on repeated execve() calls.

0.6.0 (2018-01-19)
------------------

* Use argparse, add help message.
* Better error reporting.
* Print just the command lines instead of execve() system call arguments
  (pass -v/--verbose if you want to see full execve() calls like before).
* execve() is more important than clone().
* Distinguish threads from forks.
* This was the last version released as a Gist.  Newer versions were available
  from `my scripts repository
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/scripts/blob/master/strace-process-tree>`__.
